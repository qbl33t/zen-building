# Zen Building
This game is just for getting my hand dirty in new Unity. I just want to have one completed game and try to go through all steps necessary to deploy some game. 

What I want to accomplish?
- Develop function version of the game.
- Try it on PC/Mac + mobiles (android/iOS) so "everyone" could try it and I'll receive some valuable feedback.

### Game
- Plane with just some cube in middle of it.
- In the game players' goal is to build the tower with total height.
- New cube is randomly generated around the previous one. Beginning of the game contains first cube.
- Every level increase the difficulty - speed of changing position of the new cube, maximal height level.
- Nice to have: leaderboard, practice some DB synchronization and hosting setup.

### Huge fan of #no-zero-day
What does it mean? Every day I want to do at least something. Changing color, UI, added new model or even searching for some sounds; is considered as progress!
